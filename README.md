### Hi there, I'm Sam Gehman ðŸ‘‹

I'm an applied researcher working on Gemini at Google.

I received my B.S/M.S. from the University of Washington, where I published [RealToxicityPrompts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=xMOPRkQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=xMOPRkQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) with members of [Noah Smith's lab](https://noahs-ark.github.io/).
