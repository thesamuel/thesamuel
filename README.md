### Hi there, I'm Sam Gehman ðŸ‘‹

I have a M.S. in Computer Science from University of Washington, where I focused on Natural Language Processing and published [RealToxicityPrompts](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/RealToxicityPrompts%3A-Evaluating-Neural-Toxic-in-Gehman-Gururangan/399e7d8129c60818ee208f236c8dda17e876d21f?utm_source=direct_link). I'm interested in NLP and Large Language Model safety.

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Stripe, working on the [Identity](https://www.stripe.com/identity) Machine Learning Team to train computer vision models for identity fraud prevention.
