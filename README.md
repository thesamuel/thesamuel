### Hi there, I'm Sam Gehman ðŸ‘‹

I have a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Washington, where I published [RealToxicityPrompts](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/RealToxicityPrompts%3A-Evaluating-Neural-Toxic-in-Gehman-Gururangan/399e7d8129c60818ee208f236c8dda17e876d21f?utm_source=direct_link) with members of [Noah Smith's lab](https://noahs-ark.github.io/). I'm interested in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Model safety.

I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com), working on the [Identity](https://www.stripe.com/identity) Machine Learning Team to train computer vision models for identity fraud prevention.
